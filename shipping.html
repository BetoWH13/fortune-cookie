  <h2>Shipping Info</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All Misfortune Mugs are made to order and shipped via our fulfillment partner Printful.</li>
    <li>We currently ship <strong>only within the United States</strong>.</li>
    <li>Production time is typically 2–4 business days, and shipping usually takes an additional 3–6 business days depending on your location and the mood of the postal deities.</li>
    <li>You’ll receive an email with tracking info once your mug is on its way. Please check your inbox — and your spam folder (we’re not offended).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Returns & Exchanges</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No returns or exchanges</strong> — each mug is custom printed with your dark little message. We can’t unmake your choices (and wouldn’t want to).</li>
    <li>If your mug arrives damaged or defective, contact us within 7 days at <a href="mailto:hello@misfortunecookie.net">hello@misfortunecookie.net</a> with photos, and we’ll make it right.</li>
    <li>Please don’t try to return a mug just because the quote hit too close to home. Emotional side effects are part of the experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Order Issues</h2>
  <p>If you have any problems, concerns, or philosophical awakenings during your order experience, email us. We aim to respond within 48 hours, unless we’re meditating in the sarcasm chamber.</p>
