  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: April 10, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to Misfortune Cookie — where sarcasm gets shipped in ceramic. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website, and your purchase of any misfortune-laced mugs. By using our site, you agree to abide by these terms. If you don’t agree... maybe don’t buy anything?</p>

  <h2>Ordering</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All mugs are made-to-order with your selected quote. Choose wisely — your misfortune will live on porcelain forever.</li>
    <li>Orders are processed upon successful payment via PayPal. If payment fails, your order vanishes like your hopes.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to refuse any order that violates our sarcasm standards or breaks our site. Don't test us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Shipping</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We currently ship only within the United States via Printful.</li>
    <li>Delivery typically takes 5–10 business days. Longer if the universe is being particularly moody.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Returns & Refunds</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Because every mug is customized, <strong>we do not accept returns or exchanges</strong>.</li>
    <li>If your mug arrives damaged, email us at <a href="mailto:hello@misfortunecookie.net">hello@misfortunecookie.net</a> with a photo within 7 days of delivery. We’ll sort it out like responsible adults (mostly).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>We are not responsible for emotional distress caused by reading your chosen quote too early in the morning. Our mugs are designed to provoke thought, not therapy bills.</p>

  <h2>Modifications</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we’ll post the new terms here. If the updates are major, we’ll include an eye roll and maybe even a tweet (but no promises).</p>
