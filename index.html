        // The prompt for generating misfortunes
        const misfortunePrompt = `Write a deliberately bleak, darkly funny, or emotionally unsettling fortune cookie message, as if the writer were subtly sabotaging the recipient under the guise of ancient wisdom. The tone should mimic traditional fortune cookies—brief, declarative, and slightly mystical—but twisted toward pessimism, passive aggression, or existential dread. Imagine this was written by a cynical oracle or a disgruntled employee at the fortune cookie factory trying to inject discomfort into dinner. Avoid outright cruelty or profanity—make it feel believable yet wrong, just enough to make someone frown, laugh nervously, or reflect uncomfortably. The ideal misfortune should be short (under 20 words), dryly impersonal, and leave the reader slightly worse off than before.`;
